3. After installing python, you can download the latest version of the application from https://github.com/jrremlinger/Wizard101Trivia/releases

# Will I get banned?
Unlikely, but I won't make any guarantees. From Kingsisle's perspective, you're just pressing ctrl-c, then choosing an answer. It will be difficult for them to distinguish between this program and just Googling the answers. **If you enable "Automatically copy selected text", then the program will press ctrl-c 20 times every second**. It's entirely possible for KI to detect this, so I give you fair warning. I don't think that they *will* do anything about it though, since it's probably not worth their time. If you want to be extra cautious, then disable the option and just manually copy the question yourself.
